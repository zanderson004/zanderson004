### About Me

I am currently studying a Bachelor of Mathematical & Computer Sciences at the University of Adelaide. Education is very important to me as I greatly enjoy learning, particularly in STEM fields, and I always want to know more. This interest has led me to work in tutoring and educational content development, including managing my own tutoring business.
